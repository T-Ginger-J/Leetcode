This is a project to light my github up like a christmas tree. I do daily activities elsewhere in my life, so why not something to enhance my profile? 
These problems tend to not even take up enough time to be done to fill my breakfast or lunch. I'm sure they would take longer if there wasn't AI assitance nowadays. 
I'm just going through leetcode one at a time until I get bored and start working on my own projects.

Key Differences Between Rust and C++


Ownership & Borrowing

C++: vectors are copied/passed around freely unless explicitly moved or referenced.

Rust: mut nums: Vec<i32> means ownership is moved into the function.

We can’t just "borrow" and then mutate — must declare mut.


Integer Overflow Safety

C++: adding two int values risks overflow.

Rust: nums[i] as i64 explicitly promotes to 64-bit (i64), otherwise Rust won’t compile.

Safer than C++, which silently overflows in int.


Loop Syntax

C++: for (int i = 0; i < n-3; i++)

Rust: for i in 0..n-3 {} uses a range iterator. More functional style.


Result Collection

C++: vector<vector<int>> res; res.push_back(...).

Rust: let mut res = Vec::new(); res.push(vec![...]);.

Similar, but Rust requires explicit mutability (mut).


String / Printing Differences

C++: custom printing with cout.

Rust: println!("{:?}", result); with debug formatting.


No Null / Dangling Pointers

In C++ two-pointer techniques rely on index arithmetic and can segfault if misused.

Rust forces bounds safety (nums[left] is checked at runtime).

Safer, but slightly slower unless optimized.
